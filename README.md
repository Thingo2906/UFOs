# UFOs
## Overview of the Project:
- We're creating an HTML website for this project that will allow us to use filters on the page to pull data from a javascript data file. We'd want to employ filters because we have so many distinct sightings across the United Statesâ€” depending on geographical places or the form of the sighting.
## Results:
- When our customer first visits the website, they will see the basic opening and title with the photo at the top; as they scroll down, they will see all of the data and filters that we have available (which is in the image below).

- We have five distinct filters to pick from in the image below: date, city, state, nation, and shape. You can type any of these filters into the search field, and the HTML page will display all of the sightings related to that search. Multiple filters can be input at the same time to dig deeper into the data in the current search box.

## Summary:

- We've designed a simple website that allows the visitor to utilize the search bars to sort through the various sitings in our data collection. One of the major drawbacks of our search bar is the inability to authenticate the actual sitings that can be better defined in the data. Knowing how many individuals were there during the siting might be useful in authenticating the allegations. Having as much data as possible for the website would make it the best it can be. My two suggestions for upgrading this website are: 1. more data with more information, such as how many individuals visited the site. 2. Uploading a new filter to discover sitings by length, and last but not least, having a site that regularly updates our data by adding fresh sitings to our website.
